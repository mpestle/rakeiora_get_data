# Workflow for usage in Rakeiora sandbox for the purposes
# of generating BAM and/or VCF files from the sample datasets
# available in the sandbox.
#
# Pull this repository into Rakeiora sandbox and define inputs
# as you like: If you want some BAM (reads) data, define an
# input that will prompt you for reads, single (or multi, if you want them)
# normal (or tissue, if you want them), merged however
# you want them.
#
# Then do a test run. Rakeiora will prompt you for these
# inputs and gather the ones that you select into the resources
# directory, and then this workflow will move them into the
# results directory. "results" is one of the directories that
# is copied to your jupyter hub, so you will have the datafiles
# available to you there for download or other analysis.
#
# Note that this workflow is unlikely to be approved for usage in
# the Rakeiora portal, because it returns raw data to your
# results directory.
