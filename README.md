Data retrieval

---

Retrieve data (bams or vcfs, however you wish to 
define your inputs) from the Rakeiora sandbox.

This is for the case when you wish to just have some
test data to run through your workflows.

This workflow merely copies the Rakeiora input data into
the /results directory, which in turn will be copied to
your jupyter hub area in the Rakeiora sandbox. From there
you can download it and use it in development of your
workflows.

Note that this workflow would not be approved for use
in the real Rakeiora portal, and would not be made as a
public workflow, because raw data goes back to you.

But it may be helpful for you in workflow development.
